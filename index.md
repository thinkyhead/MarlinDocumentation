## Welcome

Marlin is a highly optimized monolithic firmware designed to execute motion smoothly and reliably while maintaining a responsive user interface on a single MCU. If you need a motion system for your project consider choosing Marlin!

The sidebar has one other feature — this one from Bootstrap. If the user’s viewport is tall enough, the sidebar remains fixed on the page. This allows the user to scroll down the page and still keep the sidebar in view.

In the customsscripts.js file in the js folder, there’s a function that adds an affix class if the height of the browser window is greater than 800 pixels. If the browser’s height is less than 800 pixels, the nav affix class does not get inserted. As a result, the sidebar can slide up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

Depending on your content, you may need to adjust 800 pixel number. If your sidebar is so long that having it in a fixed position makes it so the bottom of the sidebar gets cut off, increase the 800 pixel number here to a higher number.

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
